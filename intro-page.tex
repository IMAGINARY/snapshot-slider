\noindent Snapshots are short, easy to understand articles on recent topics of mathematical research. They explain mathematical problems and ideas in an accessible and understandable way, and provide exciting insights into current topics of the mathematical community for everyone who is interested in modern mathematics.

The snapshots are all written by experts in their fields: At the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, every week 50 to 60 experts from all over the world work together on current challenges in the field of mathematics. They introduce new results, discuss different approaches and develop new ideas. After each symposium, the institute asks selected participants to explain one aspect of their research in a comprehensible language to a general audience in a few pages. A team of young mathematicians revise the articles in close collaboration with the authors and assists them in communicating complicated matters to a broad audience. Together they prepare an edited version for publication.

The snapshot project is designed to promote the understanding and appreciation of modern mathematics and mathematical research in the general public world-wide.

This snapshots slider is an exhibit of IMAGINARY, an international mathematics outreach project and network by the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach funded by the Klaus Tschira Stiftung.
