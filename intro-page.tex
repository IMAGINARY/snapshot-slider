\noindent Snapshots are short, easy to understand articles on recent topics of mathematical research. They explain mathematical problems and ideas in an accessible and understandable way, and provide exciting insights into current topics of the mathematical community for everyone who is interested in modern mathematics.

The snapshots are written by experts in their fields: At the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, every week 50 to 60 international experts work together on current challenges in mathematics. They introduce new results, discuss different approaches and develop new ideas. After each symposium, the institute asks selected participants to explain one aspect of their research to a general audience in a few pages. A team of young mathematicians revise the articles in close collaboration with the authors. Together they prepare an edited version for publication.
